Measuring the rpm of a spinning gear with magnetic sensor and Raspberry Pico

This project was done by Vannak in his Advanced Automation Class. 

## Upgrade to OLED Display and Raspberry Pico

On June 3rd the upgrade to the Pico with more memory finally worked. And the display plotted the rpm as well. Plus the plotter in Circuitpython printed the values continously.
